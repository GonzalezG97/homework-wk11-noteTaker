# Note Taker

## Description

This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes. So that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete. Powered by ExpressJS, the Note Taker app makes creating, viewing, and deleting notes a cinch!
